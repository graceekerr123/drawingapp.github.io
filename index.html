    <h1>Brief</h1>
	<p> To make a web based drawing application which allows the user to draw shapes and lines and to manage colours.
		This project needs to have a canvas environment and could include having animated drawing elements. 
		This would be designed for 7 and 8 students to help make geometric shapes and patterns exciting so they'll be more 
		enthused for the Maths subject.	</p>

<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p>I tested the colour array. I used 'console.log(colArray[1]);' and 'console.log(colArray[4]);' to test if the website returned the correct colour.</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s1test1.png" alt="A test for sprint 1">

<br>
<h3>Test Two:</h3>
<p>After I coded a Rectangle class in rectangle.js I tested it by instatiating a rectangle in main.js and calling it.
	This was a sucessful test. I was also able to check the colour, the 4th colour in the colArray.

<h3>Test Three:</h3>
<p>I tested all the mouse listeners to make sure they work properly. As you can see, the consol log shows that they are.</p>

<h3>Test Four:</h3>
<P>I tested that the outline for the rectangle worked correctly. It was good that the rectangle outlined appeared, but I did
	 find a problem with this test. This problem happens when the drag extends beyond the boundaries of the canvas, as beyond the boundaries 
	 the mouse isn't registered because there is no mouse listeners on this part of the screen. In the test, when the user tries to draw a 
	 rectangle outside of the canvas, the rectangle guide remains the same until the mouse returns to inside the boundaries again.
	 
	 the code doesn't realise this as mouse up 
and the program goes

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>I think that this sprint went smoothly as I didn't encounter many problems while getting to the final base product which is sprint 1. Sprint one
	 is the simpliest application i could possibly make. Now we can improve through the subsequent sprints.
This was a very important sprint because I was able to get some major elements of my wed based drawing application working such as the canvas,
and secondly the ability to draw a rectangle guide and rectangle. Through testing it became apparant that the code that I have at the moment
for the canvas isn't suffient for a web application to go out into the real world. It's clear that in a later sprint that I will have to 
fix the problem I found, that the rectangle guide is not updated when the mouse goes outside of the canvas. Although this problem should be fixed before
the project is finished, it isn't as high a priority as other basic functions this application is expected to have including buttons and 
a colour selector. For this reason, I'll be adding this problem to my backlog. Next sprint, I think I'll focus on creating a drawing area inside 
the canvas which will make my application look more structured and professional. 

<br><br>

A plus on working on this next is that it will minimise the problem of the mouse not being registered outside of the canvas. This is because
having a separate box inside the whole canvas indicates to the user that they're expected to draw all the shapes inside the smaller box (the 
drawing area) instead of the canvas. And due to the fact that mouse listeners are on the canvas as whole then if the user happens to go over the 
drawing area outline the rectangle will still draw the shape (although I predict I will have to code a function to make sure the shape stays inbounds)
instead of not updating the rectangle shape like before. The not updating of the shape outline will still occur if the user tries to draw the shape from the drawing box to outside
to the canvas and outside again to the document body. However, sprint 2 makes it less likely that this problem will occur for a regularly abiding user.

<h2>AIM</h2>
<p>To create a drawing area inside the canvas, so that the user can only make shapes in the drawing area, 
	instead of the whole canvas area. The area outside of the drawing area will be for buttons deciding shapes and colours 
	- all things to be made in further sprints.

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s2plan.png" alt="The kanban sheet for sprint 2">


<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p>This was a problem with registering the proper coordinates when mouse is down. After considering the issue and the tests
	i've done,
	 I realised it was a problem with updating the w and h of the rectangle. This is likely due to the fact that
	 the update function can't run at the same time as the down function which causes the w and h to not always be updated.
	
</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s2test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p> While testing this I console loged the widths and the height as well as 'console.log(temp)' to understand this more. It became clear that the
	   displacement of the mouse's position from the original click and next tap (check this) became the width and height
	for the random rectangle that appeared when I tapped. </p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s2test1.png" height=400 alt="The is a screenshot for sprint 2">
  <p>I have two possible solutions. This first was to run 'update()' inside the 'down' function.... This is bad because essentially
	  'down()' will run twice which is not very efficient.
  </p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s2test2.png"  height=400 alt="The is a screenshot for sprint 2">
  <p>My second solution is to reset w and h to 0 inside the 'down' function. This is good becuase it fixed the problem. It is a better
	  solution that my first solution as it's more efficient as it makes sure that my program only needs to run once.

<h2>AIM</h2>
<p> To allow the user to change the drag and drop shape. I will make two buttons, one for the rectangle drag a drop (already coded)
	and the other for an ellipse drag and drop (to be coded), for the user to switch between.

	
	To have a viable product.
</p>

<br><br><h2>PLAN</h2> 
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s3plan.png" alt="The planning sheet for sprint _">

<p>I have a static variable with button selected, so that if it changes for one button it'll change for
	all of the buttons.

	There will be static variable called Button.Shape. Which will equal either rectangle or ellipse.
</p>



<br><br><h2>KANBAN BOARD</h2> 
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s3kanban.png" alt="The kanban sheet for sprint 3">

<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Testing the Ellipse</h3>
<p>I want to test the ellipse function and then test the drag and drop of the ellipse. This is important to do
	before trying to implement the button code because it will make fixing any problems a million times easier.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/ellipse1.png" alt="The ellipse test for sprint 3">

<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p> Testing the button:<br>
	It is clear that the button was instatiated properly. I also check in inbounds
	for the button and it is clear that it worked. Something to note is that the outline
	of the button is not considered inBounds. I did this by using simple code (as shown below)
	and I think to make it more efficient code, I will make sure to add buttons in a list, also
	with another list with the button names in it. The loop will run through the list of the buttons
	and the list of the button names. This will definetly be more efficient as
	in the future sprints i'm expecting to have numerous buttons, and therefore, it make sense that 
	a better system of storing the button information is needed.

  <h3>Iterative Decision</h3>
  <p>First Choice: to have a varaible defined in the constructure which can be true or false depending on whether or not
	  the button is selected. 
	  <br>
	  Second Choice: to have a static variable - so only one button is the chosen button.
	  <br>
	  We can see the effectiveness of the first choice in test two. 
  </p>

<br>
<h3>Test Two:</h3>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s3test2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

<p>Testing more than one button at the same time. And testing that the change of colours depending
	if the mouse is hovering over the button is working. I'm using the idea of my first choice for this. I was sucessful in making two buttons appear on the page
	and the hover over the buttons also works. As you ca see from my console log, the false and true is working properly.
<br>
	However, there was a problem with the selection of the buttons as when I tried to select a button for the second time. 
	By this I mean that after already selecting a button and wanting to select the other button, the code wouldn't deselect the first button.
	It was because of this that I decided that my first choice of the iteraive decison is inherted flawed, as it doesn't
	deselect buttons when i'm selecting another one. I want to try the static variable. After incorprating the static variable
	into my code, it seems like it is the better option as it makes sure that only one button is chosen at one point of time.
<br>
	The static variable is at the very end after declaring the class. It is called 'Button.Clicked'. This is more practical

</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Test 3</h3>
  <p> I wanted to test that the drag and drop of the ellipse worked, however when I drew it, it was very much so enlarged
	  and didn't fit the screen.
	  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s3test3.png" height=400 alt="The problem in sprint 3">
<br>
	  I then came across another problem, and that is that my ellipse's that I was drawing weren't changing depending
	  on the movements of the mouse. I fixed this problem by fixing the parameters (is this the right word?) for when I 
	  define (is this the right word?) the Ellipse inside the 'controlobject.js' just before it's pushed to the temp list. 
	  Before the width and height was defined as 'w' and 'h', and to fix this I changed it to 'this.w' and 'this.h'. So the width and
	  height taken are the integers that are onces that are passed through controlobject.js rather than the w and h defined in main.js.
Is this word right?

	  <br>
	  Another problem that I noticed during this test is that before selecting any buttons, it still draws the guide rectangle
		and then doesn't draw any shape. I will put on the backlog to make sure that the guide will only draw after one of the buttons 
		is selected. This will make it less confusing for the user. 
	  <video class="center" controls>
		<source src="assets/vids/s3test3.mov" type="video/mp4">
	  </video>

	</p>


<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>Big thing is that the shapes can only be only colour. I need colour options. Why not a colour palette at the bottom
	of the page - give a whole list of options. This seems like it's the biggest priority because it's important for the
	user to have different colours to draw with to foster creativity.

	<br>
	I learnt the importance of static variables which will help me in future sprints.

<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p>Testing that two swatches work:
<br>
This was alright because Swatches are very similar to buttons. So I learnt from all my mistakes I made in sprint 3 while
creating two interactive buttons, and applied this while making swatches. A big part of this was reconigising the importantance
of static variables from very early on in the sprint. I learnt from the previous sprint that static variables are crucical 
for interactive spaces/area (IS THAT THE RIGHT WORD?) on the canvas as if the button or swatch leads to a particiular action, 
then we need a swatch to make sure that the action is always true for each interactive area that is clicked on. (DOES THIS MAKES SENSE?)
As you can see, I had no iterative decision as I knew from the get go that a static variable is the obvious way to go.

</p>

<h3>Test Two:</h3>
<p>This will be testing that the two swatches work properly. Ahh perfect so good. But please do explain in detail what
	is occuring in this test </p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s4test2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

  <h3>Iterative decision</h3>
<p>
Now that I know two swatches work, I need to make sure that all colours from my three tiered colour array (in init.js)
are displayed on the screen and that all of these function properly.
</p>
<h4>Option 1</h4>
<p>This is to instantiate all swatches in main.js. Due to my 3 x 10 colour pallette /colour array, this will essentially
	30 lines of code to instatiate all the colours (with the varing transparancys) and then push all 30 of these to a list, 
	from which we can create all of these on the canvas with a loop. Although this may be time consuming, it's a very logical
	way to attatck the problem of getting so many swatches onto the canvas.
	<br>
	As you can see from the photo below, I coded 6 swatches like this. It was very time consuming for only a small pay off.
	Further adding to the fact that option 1 is flawed, is that I only coded 6 out of 30 swatched, which only emphaisises
	how many lines of code.
<br>

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s4decision1.png" height=400 alt="Iterative deicison or sprint 4">
</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>
<p>This option is to make a loop that would instatiate all of the swatches. This may be more difficult to code and may take
	more time to develop this code. However if I do consider this the better and more effective option, then I think it's worth
	spending a bit more time on it to make it good. The benefits outweight the extra time, espeically as colours is a major 
	component of this program. From the last two screenshots, it shows that I can easily change the size of the colour palette by easily 
	changing a couple of numbers - so easy!

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s4decision2b.png" height=400 alt="Iterative deicison for sprint 4">
</p>


<h4>Decision</h4>
<p>In the end I decided that Option 2 is more practical as the code is more compact. This is better for the code as it helps
	the code repeating itself so many time. This also makes it more functional, so another coder could come and work on my drawing
	app and know exactly which part of code to look for to help fix the program if there's a problem. And if there is a problem, they
	would only need to fix code in one place rather than 30 lines - which is way easier.
</p>


<h3>Test Three: Testing full palette</h3>
<p> While coding the full colour palette, using option 2 I ran into a few problems. The first is that nothing appeared
	in terms of the colour palette and I also lost control of the buttons. However while console logging my code, I could
	deduct that the instatiating of the swatches was working perfectly as 30 swatches were instaitated. From this I know that 
	there is a problem creating this instatiated swatches.

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>At this point I've coded all the major parts of this program including a drawing area, a choice of shapes and
	a choice of colours. I think that the next priority it to expand on the options that I already have, espeically
	the drawing options. Having more shape options seems like a big priority to me as anyone who downloads a drawing app
	would expect a reasonably variety of drawing options.

	<br>
	Viable project or something

	<br>
	As you can see from one of the testing videos that the drawing area gets filled up pretty fast,
	I think that it would be helpful to make sure that the user has the option of an undo button which would 
	erase the shapes they drew. This would make the drawing app better as it would be more flexible as it 
	would let users to have the option to redraw their shapes and draw more than before. As you can see, I can think of
	many other features to include

<p> <b>How to fix the current mouse listener problem</b>
	The problem is that the mouse up event is not recognise if the user goes beyound the boundary of the canvas.
This is a problem because the mouse listeners are only attached the the canvas.

Options 1) Allow the user to carry on (?) 

Option 2) When they draw out, the box goes up the boundary

Option 3) Create a clipping mask so everything that gets drawn after the canvas gets cut off
