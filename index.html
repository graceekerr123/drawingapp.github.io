    <h1>Brief</h1>
	<p> To make a web based drawing application which allows the user to draw shapes and lines and to manage colours.
		This project needs to have a canvas environment and could include having animated drawing elements. 
		This would be designed for 7 and 8 students to help make geometric shapes and patterns exciting so they'll be more 
		enthused for Math.	</p>
<br>
<h1>What I had to consider:</h1>
<p>Using agile processes by developing the project using sprints
	<br>Decomposing into smaller components by buliding the programme one function at a time (usually it was one function per sprint)
	<br>Coming up for multiple approaches to a function or fixing a component, as shown in the iterative deicsions
	<br>Testing regually, during and at the end of each sprint - so I can address problems as I discover them
	<br>Managing a product backlog so I can protise which features are most important
	<br>Using GitHub to reguarly commit my finished sprints on git hub</p>

<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p>I tested the colour array. I used 'console.log(colArray[1]);' and 'console.log(colArray[4]);' to test if the website returned the correct colour.</p>

<h3>Test Two:</h3>
<p>After I coded a Rectangle class in rectangle.js I tested it by instatiating a rectangle in main.js and calling it.
	This was a sucessful test. I was also able to check the colour, the 4th colour in the colArray.
</p>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s1test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

<h3>Test Four:</h3>
<P>I tested that the outline for the rectangle worked correctly. It was good that the rectangle outlined appeared, but I did
	 find a problem with this test. This problem happens when the drag extends beyond the boundaries of the canvas, as beyond the boundaries 
	 the mouse isn't registered because there is no mouse listeners on this part of the screen. So when the user tries to draw a 
	 rectangle outside of the canvas, the rectangle guide remains the same until the mouse returns to inside the boundaries again.

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>I think that this sprint went smoothly as I didn't encounter many problems. Sprint one
	 is very simple and I can improve more through the subsequent sprints.
This was a very important sprint because I was able to get some major elements of my wed based drawing application working such as the canvas,
and secondly the ability to draw a rectangle guide and rectangle. Through testing it became apparant that the code that I have at the moment
for the canvas isn't suffient for a web application to go out into the real world. It's clear that in a later sprint that I will have to 
fix the problem I found, that the rectangle guide is not updated when the mouse goes outside of the canvas. Although this problem should be fixed before
the project is finished, it isn't as high a priority as other basic functions this application is expected to have including buttons and 
a colour selector. For this reason, I'll be adding this problem to my backlog. Next sprint, I think I'll focus on creating a drawing area inside 
the canvas which will make my application look more structured and professional. 

<br><br>

Sprint 2, working on a drawing page, is great because this will minimise the problem of the mouse not being registered outside of the canvas. This is because
having a separate box inside the whole canvas indicates to the user that they're expected to draw all the shapes inside the smaller box (the 
drawing area) instead of anywhere on the canvas. And due to the fact that mouse listeners are on the canvas as whole then if the user happens to go over the 
drawing area outline the rectangle will still draw the shape (although I predict I will have to code a function to make sure the shape stays inbounds). 
The not updating of the shape outline will still occur if the user tries to draw the shape from the drawing box to outside
to the canvas and outside again to the document body. However, sprint 2 makes it less likely that this problem will occur for a regularly abiding user.
</p>

<h2>AIM</h2>
<p>To create a drawing area inside the canvas, so that the user can only make shapes in the drawing area, 
	instead of the whole canvas area. The area outside of the drawing area will be for buttons deciding shapes and colours 
	- all things to be made in further sprints.

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s2plan.png" alt="The kanban sheet for sprint 2">


<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p>This was a problem with registering the proper coordinates when mouse is down. After considering the issue and the tests
	i've done,
	 I realised it was a problem with updating the w and h of the rectangle. This is likely due to the fact that
	 the update function can't run at the same time as the down function which causes the w and h to not always be updated.
	
</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s2test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p> While testing this I console loged the widths and the height as well as 'console.log(temp)' to understand this more. It became clear that the
	   displacement of the mouse's position from the original click and next tap (check this) became the width and height
	for the random rectangle that appeared when I tapped. </p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s2test1.png" height=400 alt="The is a screenshot for sprint 2">
  <p>I have two possible solutions. This first was to run 'update()' inside the 'down' function.... This is bad because essentially
	  'down()' will run twice which is not very efficient.
  </p>
  <p>My second solution is to reset w and h to 0 inside the 'down' function. This is good becuase it fixed the problem. It is a better
	  solution that my first solution as it's more efficient as it makes sure that my program only needs to run once. I chose the second soultion.

<br><br>
<h3>Test Two:</h3>

<p>Test the boundraries. It works. I clicked on various parts of the screen particularly focusing on and around the boundrary of the 
	drawing area and the whole canvas. I can tell my boundary check is working properly because whenever I click inside the drawing page, even 
	close the barrier, it will return true. And then even 1 px outside of the boundary, the code will reture false (as it is not inside the drawing area).

	draged out into the canvas (not apart of the drawing area).

<p>I chose option 2 which aims to keep the xMouse and yMouse values withn the border of the drawing area.</p>
<p>Test that my click and drag guide and rectangle only works for inside the drawing area. I tested this on every boundary. It works.</p>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s2test5.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

  <p>During this test, I found this problem when the mouse went outside of the canvas entirely and just on the webpage.
	  The mouse wouldn't be registered until it went back on the canvas. This is because there are no mouse listeners on the entirety of the webpage. 
	  However, this is a small flaw so it's put to the bottom of the backlog. It's very clear that shape options and colour management are more important for 
	  the time being. 
  </p>

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>Doing these tests there isn't any element of creativity yet. I think that while the next sprint nexts to work on another big idea, that it also 
	needs to be creative too. To satistfy this need I would like to give the user an option. Going on further, I think i also need to work on more shapes because I let the 
	user chose colours. I think that making sure my sprint focuses on two options, e.g. two shape buttons, will allow my project to reach a mimimum viable product level. I believe 
	that all the work I put into making sure that the webpage and all the boundaries are working accuractly, allows me to focus on shapes and colours for the majority 
	of the rest of my project.

<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Testing the Ellipse</h3>
<p>I want to test the ellipse function and then test the drag and drop of the ellipse. This is important to do
	before trying to implement the button code because it will make fixing any problems a million times easier.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/ellipse1.png" alt="The ellipse test for sprint 3">

<h3>Test One:</h3>
<p> Testing the button:<br>
	It is clear that the button was instatiated properly. I also check in inbounds
	for the button and it is clear that it worked. I using simple code (as shown below)
	and to make my code more efficient. I will make sure to add buttons in a list, also
	with another list with the button names in it. The loop will run through the list of the buttons
	and the list of the button names. This will definetly be more efficient as
	in the future sprints i'm expecting to have numerous buttons, and therefore, it make sense that 
	a better system of storing the button information is needed.

  <h3>Iterative Decision</h3>
  <p>Option 1: to have a varaible defined in the constructor which can be true or false depending on whether or not
	  the button is selected. 
	  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s3test10.png" alt="The code for sprint 3">
	  <br>
	  Option 2: to have a static variable - so only one button is the chosen button. I have a static variable called 'Button.Clicked' to make it so only one button can be selected at one time.
	  There will also be a static variable called 'Button.Shape'. Which will equal the text of what's on the button, so either rectangle or ellipse.
  </p>

<br>
<h3>Testing option 1:</h3>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s3test2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

<p>Testing more than one button at the same time using the variable 'this.clicked'. And testing that the change of colours depending
	if the mouse is hovering over the button is working. I'm using the idea of my first choice for this. I was sucessful in making two buttons appear on the page
	and the hover over the buttons also works. As you ca see from my console log, the false and true is working properly.
<br>
	However, there was a problem with the selection of the buttons as when I tried to select a button for the second time. 
	By this I mean that after already selecting a button and wanting to select the other button, the code wouldn't deselect the first button.
	<br>
	It was because of this that I decided that my first choice of the iteraive decison is inherted flawed, as it doesn't
	deselect buttons when i'm selecting another one. I want to try the static variable. After incorprating the static variable
	into my code, it seems like it is the better option as it makes sure that only one button is chosen at one point of time.
<br>
	The static variable is at the very end after declaring the class. It is called 'Button.Clicked'. This is more practical. You see the selection 
	working properly in future tests.

</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Test 3</h3>
  <p> I wanted to test that the drag and drop of the ellipse worked, however when I drew it, it was very much so enlarged
	  and didn't fit the screen.
	  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s3test3.png" height=400 alt="The problem in sprint 3">
<br>
	  I then came across another problem, and that is that my ellipse's that I was drawing weren't changing depending
	  on the movements of the mouse and instead a fixed sized ellipse was drawn when I clicked.
	   I fixed this problem by fixing the variables for when I 
	  instaitate the Ellipse inside the 'controlobject.js' just before it's pushed to the temp list. 
	  Before the width and height was defined as 'w' and 'h', and to fix this I changed it to 'this.w' and 'this.h'.These are being updated from the mouse
	  move function. So the width and
	  height taken are the integers that are onces that are passed through controlobject.js rather than the w and h defined in main.js.

	  <br>
	  Another problem that I noticed during this test is that before selecting any buttons, it still draws the guide rectangle
		and then doesn't draw any shape. I will put on the backlog to make sure that the guide will only draw after one of the buttons 
		is selected. This will make it less confusing for the user. 
	  <video class="center" controls>
		<source src="assets/vids/s3test3.mov" type="video/mp4">
	  </video>

	</p>


<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p> A huge limitation of the program at the moment is that the shapes being clicked and dragged are only one colour. 
	It would be amazing for the user to have colour options. Firsly, it's boring to only have one colour; secondly, it doesn't give the user 
	much freedom to be creative if they don't get to chose a colour. A colour palette at the bottom
	of the page - give a whole list of colour options - is the logical next step. This seems like it's the biggest priority because it's important for the
	user to have different colours to draw with to foster creativity. So while the other things I've mention like more shape options and the guide not being the best 
	aren't important compared to not having any colour management system at present.
	<br>
	In this sprint I learnt alot, espeically about the importance of static variables which will help me in future sprints. I am expecting a future need 
	to make another set of buttons (or explore this option) in a future sprint, so it'll be good to remember the lesson I learnt about how effective static 
	variables are. Creating this button class, although very difficult, will help me in the future making another class about buttons (if I need) as I will have prior knowledge.

<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One - Testing that two swatches work:</h3>
<p>
The process of writing the code was alright because Swatches are very similar to buttons. So I learnt from all my mistakes I made in sprint 3 while
creating two interactive buttons, and applied this while making swatches. A big part of this was reconigising the importantance
of static variables from very early on in the sprint. I learnt from the previous sprint that static variables are crucical 
for interactive spaces on the canvas. As you can see, I didn't need a iterative decision as I knew from the get go that a static variable is the obvious way to go.
<br>
For this test, I clicked on both of the swatches to make sure that each swatch was deselected if another swatch was selected. I also tried to 
draw a shape, but as you can see the colour of the shapes made didn't change with the swatch selection.
</p>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s4test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>



<h3>Test Two: Testing that the swatches connected with the controlobject</h3>
<p>This will be testing that the two swatches work properly and have properly connected with the control object. If they have been connected correctly, 
	clicking the the swatches will change the colour of the shapes being drawn. This has happened because the ellipses and rectangles that are being 
	drawn now are green and yellow - the colour of the swatches. However, the next step is to make sure the user has more than 2 colour options. </p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s4test2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

  <h3>Iterative decision</h3>
<p>
Now that I know two swatches work, I need to make sure that all colours from my three tiered colour array (in init.js)
are displayed on the screen and that all of these function properly.
</p>
<h4>Option 1</h4>
<p>This is to instantiate all swatches in main.js. Due to my 3 x 10 colour pallette /colour array, this will essentially
	30 lines of code to instatiate all the colours (with the varing transparancys) and then push all 30 of these to a list, 
	from which we can create all of these on the canvas with a loop. Although this may be time consuming, it's a very logical
	way to attatck the problem of getting so many swatches onto the canvas.
	<br>
	As you can see from the photo below, I coded 6 swatches like this. It was very time consuming for only a small pay off.
	Further adding to the fact that option 1 is flawed, is that I only coded 6 out of 30 swatched, which only emphaisises
	how many lines of code.
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s4decision1a.png" height=150 alt="Iterative deicison or sprint 4">
	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s4decision1.png" height=400 alt="Iterative deicison or sprint 4">
</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>
<p>This option is to make a loop that would instatiate all of the swatches. This may be more difficult to code and may take
	more time to develop this code. However if I do consider this the better and more effective option, then I think it's worth
	spending a bit more time on it to make it good. The benefits outweight the extra time, espeically as colours is a major 
	component of this program. From the last two screenshots, it shows that I can easily change the size of the colour palette by easily 
	changing a couple of numbers - so easy!

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s4decision2b.png" height=400 alt="Iterative deicison for sprint 4">
</p>


<h4>Decision</h4>
<p>In the end I decided that Option 2 is more practical as the code is more compact. This is better for the code as it helps
	the code repeating itself so many time. This also makes it more functional, so another coder could come and work on my drawing
	app and know exactly which part of code to look for to help fix the program if there's a problem. And if there is a problem, they
	would only need to fix code in one place rather than 30 lines - which is way easier.
</p>


<h3>Test Three: Testing full palette</h3>
<p> While coding the full colour palette, using option 2 I ran into a few problems. The first is that nothing appeared
	in terms of the colour palette and I also lost control of the buttons. However while console logging my code, I could
	deduct that the instatiating of the swatches was working perfectly as 30 swatches were instaitated. From this I know that 
	there is a problem updating the swatches so they print. The problem was with the update function.
	I fixed this by throurgh testing through the use of 'console.log's.

<p>It works now</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s4test3.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>



<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>At this point I've coded all the major parts of this program including a drawing area, a choice of shapes and
	a choice of colours. From the colour management that I completed this sprint, I don't think I'll need to improve on
	it during this project as it's such a good colour managament system that doesn't have any flaws (from my testing).
	I think that the next priority it to expand on the shapes options that I already have. Having more shape options seems
	 like a big priority to me as anyone who downloads a drawing app
	would expect a reasonably variety of drawing options. Although that what I have at the moment is a viable project that I could release into the real world, 
	it isn't anything too special at the moment with only two options. Having a wide variety of shape options will attract users and then 
	more people will learn about Maths and geometric shapes.

	<br>
	As you can see from one of the testing videos that the drawing area gets filled up pretty fast,
	I think that it would be helpful to make sure that the user has the option of an undo button which would 
	erase the shapes they drew. This would make the drawing app better as it would be more flexible as it 
	would let users to have the option to redraw their shapes and draw more than before. As you can see, I can think of
	many other features to include in my project. I think this will become the next priority after making sure that we have more than 2 
	shape options. This is because with more than 2 shapes options the drawing area will definetly fill up faster and it will be 
	a bigger problem (a problem that will need immediate addressing) that needs fixing.

<h3>Test One: To see if my Triangle Class works</h3>
<p>Originally I did run into some problems testing to see if the triangle class worked. However after testing my code with creating the triangle
	at different points (e.g the begining, middle or end) of the 'function animate()' inside 'main.js'. The problem I had was that the triangle was
	showing up behind other page elements so it looked like I messed up some code up inside the Triangle class. When I moved to code to
	create the triangle to the end of the 'function animate()', the triangle was visible as it is printed after all other page elements.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s5test1.png" height=400 alt="A test for sprint 5">

<p>
After console logging I could see it wasn't a problem with the Triangle class as the triangle was instatiated properly as shown by the screenshot below.
From doing this, I could look at other parts of the code to check - testing my programme in parts an efficient way to test.
</p>

<h3>Test Two: Test my triangle button</h3> 
<p>I encounted a problem which was that no matter which direction I dragged the mouse, from the mouse position of mouse down, it would create a triangle
	to the left, and down a bit. This problem is due to my x,y,w,h values inside the Triangle class not relating to where mouse is clicked or when mouse is released.
	The values for width and height were written as absoulte values, so the triangle won't be created in the designated position. To fix this I took away the absoulte
	value code. Now it works properly. As you'll see in a upcoming video.

<p> However, I found a problem,one of many I've encountered during this process. This problem was that the polygon wasn't drawn inside the bounding box. To fix this I had to make sure to make the radius half
	of h or w, depending whether the height or width is smallest. In my video, you see when I drag and drag a bounding box with a small width and a big height, 
	it will make a polygon based on the large height - making a big polygon. The ideal polygon to be created is one within a square with a side length which is
	the width of the original bounding box. This ensures that the polygon created is fully inside the bounding box created by the user. To fully understand this idea,
	I have to understand that a polygon is made using a circle and the radius of this circle. To fix this problem I will have to put conditions on the radius value. 
	This becomes a problem as the polygon might end up outside the drawing area, like shown in the image above. This happens as if the bounding box is drawn close 
	to the edge of the drawing area and the radius value used to draw the polygon is big. When this occurs, the polygon can be created outside of the bounding box and
	therefore, there's a possibility that it could be drawn outside of the drawing area.
</p>

  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s5test4.png" height=100  alt="Code for sprint 5">
  <p>To fix this I had to make my code to account for this. So I made code (as shown below) that when the height (of the bounding box) is smaller than the width (
	  of the bounding box) it will draw a polygon with a radius half of the height (of the bounding box) which means that the diameter will length h. 
	  Since h is smaller that w, the polygon will fit into the bounding box well. Then if the width (of the bounding box) is smaller than height (of the 
	  bounding box) then the code will draw a polygon with radius hald of the width (of the bounding box) which means that the diameter will be a size of w.
	  This means that the polygon will fit inside the bounding box dragged by the user. And if the bounding box doesn't fit either of these conditions, it will 
	  mean that the bounding box has an equal height and width. In this case, the radius will be half h, which is also equililent to half w. This will
	  also have a accuractly sized polygon inside the bounding box.
	  
  </p>

  <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s5test3b.png" height=250  alt="A test for sprint 5">

  <p>After analysing this solution, I found that there too much repition within the code. because I have 3 conditions and then create
	  a new polygon and then push it into the object list for each condition. It would be better to have a more functional code. I'm thinking 
	that to do this I would have a condition on only one of  the variables, this would be R (the radius) as this is the only value I was changing
in the code. This worked better, as you can see below. I was having problems testing  a condition on R in controlobject.js, so I decided to try a 
new approach and add this variable in my Polygon class. The code is shown below. For this new code, I had to define the variabe R inside class. Since 
R depends on the values of the width and height of the bounding box I had to pass this through the code. To do this I added h and w to the 
parameters to the class and the include these values in the constructor as well as put this.w and this.w inside the code instatiating the polygons inside 
control.object.js. </p>

<h3>Iterative Decision</h3>
<p>However as a polygon could mean so many shapes depending on the amount of sides the polygon has. For example, a six
	sideed polygon is a hexagon while a 10 sided polygon is a decagon. For this reason I think it makes the most sense for the user that they
	choose the amount of sides the polygon would have. If I do this the user won't have to wonder what type of polygon they'll get when clicking on
	this button.
</p></p>

<h4>Option One:</h4>
<p>This option is to code 3 different buttons each with a different n value which I will distinguish in the code when instatiating the button. To do this I had 
	buttons like Pentagon, Hexagon and Heptagon and I have manually change the n value for each button. The outcome for this is acceptable, so this is a valid option.

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s5testO1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

<br>
<h4>Option Two:</h4>
<p>For this solution I create a new button set that is solely for different polygon options. This option is more complex than option 1 as I need to 
	create more button code, as there needs to be a different static variable. This is becasuse if these buttons with '4', '5' and '6' (ect) were in 
	same button set as the other shape buttons, then if the user clicks on one of the number of sides options it will deselect the polygon being selected.
	This is due to the static variable making sure only one button being selected at one time. 
	<br>
	Because these buttons operate a little differently I want there to
	be a little bit of a distinction from these buttons compared to the other buttons. To do this I would like to have a gap, however that's not possible
	with the code for the button placement in main.js. So I will have to improve this code as well for this option - however, this would be something I would've had
	to do later on anyway.

<h3>Testing the button selection works</h3>
<p>I created a new class called 'Polygon_buttons' that will be used to create the buttons that have the side length options for the polygon.
	I had to create a new side length buttons for this. It makes sense that these side length buttons to be smaller. For the new 'Polygon_buttons'
	class I had to make 2 new static variables; 1 to make sure that only one of these side length buttons can be selected at one time, and the other
	to make sure that the number of sides could be passed through to other sections of code.
</p>

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s5testO2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

  <p>As you can see that my new 'Polygon_buttons' class works as these side buttons can be selected when the shape buttons are also selected - which is
	  a crucial part of this option. As mentioned, this is due to their being a new class of buttons that is separate to the original shape buttons.
	I haven't connected the actual instaitation of different sized polygons to the buttons yet. I see 
	  is that the side length button is still selected when the user decides to draw another shape, but this is advantageous because then the next time the user 
	  wants to draw a polygon the last selected side legnth will still be available. 

  </p>

  <h3>Testing the side length buttons works</h3>
  <video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s5testO2a.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

  <p> I connected the 'Polygon_buttons.Sides' static variable to the instatiation of the polygon. As you can see when I click on the Polygon button and then 
	  a side length, it creates the correct polygon. If the user only clicks a side length and not the polygon button, no shape is created if the user tries; this is 
	  what we want as we don't know if the user actually wants a polygon. If the user draws a polygon and the goes to select another shape, the number of sides button 
	  will remain selected - but this is fine because it draws the new shape and not a polygon. Also, if the user goes back to drawing polygons it will automatically draw
	  polygons with the number of sides.

  </p>




<h4>Decison:</h4>
<p>I chose option 2 because it is a better solution in many ways. Most significantly option 2 is better because it useds a variable (Button.Sides) instead of a literal (e.g. 6 for a hexagon).
	Option 2 allows me to easily add another polygon button for a side length without adding too many lines of code; all I would do is to create a new button conntecting it to the polygonbuttons set.
	This is because the number of sides relates to the number (text) on the button, and this is connected to the 'n' side lengths. While option one depends on
	each button being pushed to a list seperately, while in option 2 this can be done in a loop (more efficient and functional). Also, option 2 is better because it makes the 
	selection of the number of sides to be independent of the shape selection which gives more input to the user so they can have more creativity - which is what we want.

<br>
However, option two makes the buttons seem more asthetically pleasing on the page, as option 2 gives the option for the number of sides in smaller buttons. This is better than option 1, which 
has seperate large buttons for each polygon options which contributes to the clutter of the page. Going into further sprints i can see that clutter is becoming a bigger problem,
so I should do what I can do now to minimise this.
</p>


<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>I believe that I made very big improvments in my code this sprint as I added more shape options which really adds to the possibility a user has while using this web application. 
	I think I should revisit the idea I had last sprint about needing a clear and undo button because it's clearly more of a priority now as the user has so many 
	shapes to click and drag with that the drawing area does get cluttered quickly. Since I have an adequite amount of shape options and a good colour management, I feel 
	like I can dedicate my time to other features like a clear and undo button. These buttons will improve my program so much, much more than another shape button 
	at this point in time.

<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s6testa.mov" type="video/mp4">

  <p>The selection of the buttons works well. As when either the undo or clear all button is clicked, the orginal shapes buttons will
	  be deselected.
</p>


	
	<h3>Test Two: Making sure the buttons work </h3>

	<video class="center" controls>
		<source src="assets/vids/s6test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
	  </video>
	
<p>As you can see, my clear all and undo buttons are not completely functional. If i have a bunch of shapes on the page, and if I click on 
	undo it won't work; but if I click up and down again (inside the drawing area), it'll remove a shape. This is also the same for the clear all 
	button - as the shapes will only be cleared after I click inside the drawing area after clicking the clear all button.
	 From this test, I know that there's a delay because the programme is not recognising when the mouse goes up the first time.
</p>

<p>After some more testing, I know that this is because the code for the clear and undo buttons and the code that recognises what 'Button.Clicked' is (inside button.js), are running at the 
	same time. Along with the fact that the clear all/undo code is place in the 'mUp' function inside the 'controlobject.js' at the moment. For example, for the undo 
	button, the 'Button.Clicked = "undo"' is reconised at the same time as the 'if Button.Clicked = "undo"' code. Due to this, the result of the 'Button.Clicked = "undo"'
	is never carried out asnthe undo/clear all button isn't being processed until the 'mUp' function is called again and this occurs when the user clicks again. To fix 
	this I will put the code for the clear all and undo inside the update function, so it is running all the time.
 </p>
 <video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s6test12.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p>As you can see I fixed this problem, and now it works. So it will always undo the last drawn shape when clicking the undo button. Also the programme will always
	  clear all the shapes on the screen if I click the clear all button. 
  </p>

<br>
	<p>I had to make sure to have 'Button.Shape = "";' at the end of each command for clearing or undoing. This is because if 
		these buttons are not deselected then the code will keep poping the last drawn shape until there is no shapes on the drawing board. And this is something
		that the user did not ask for.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p>I think the program is looking good at the moment but I do see room for improvment because there aren't that many features right now.
		Next thing to work on is another feature, I'm thinking that drawing a line would come in handy to the user.</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s7test.png" width=400 alt="Test for sprint 7">

<h3>Test Two: Testing the button works properly.</h3>
<p>There is a problem. This is because I set the end coordinates of the line to be the width and height of the bounding box. When I did this, it took the values 
	of the width and height of the bounding box and adjusted them according to the 0,0 (the top left corner) of the page. To fix this I need
	to set the end coordinates of the line to the position of the x and y mouse. This is because this will be the edge of the bounding box.
</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s7test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
<p>The line now works. But it seems like when the line has a thick width (for example, 10) the line could be created pass the boundary 
	of the drawing area. This means that my solution, to the problem of the shapes could be made outside the drawin area, 
	that makes the bounding box not being able to go outside of the drawing area - doesn't fix this problem. 
	Because as the xMouse and yMouse values are kept within the border of the drawing area, the shapes instatiated using these xMouse and yMouse values 
	can still go over the boundary. I will keep this problem in mind for later and put it on my backlog.
</p>

  <video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s7test1a.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>



<h3>Test Two:</h3>

<p>I'm also interested to take away the bounding box for the line as there's no reason to have it as it's drawing a line not a shape. This is because 
	the user can use where their cursor is to figure out where the line is going to end up. This also makes my programme cleaner. I did this by adding 
	a condition on the drawing 'drawRectGuide' inside the draw function inside 'controlobject.js'. This condition was the static variable 'Button.Shape' 
	had to equal the shapes where I wanted the retangle guide like Polygon and rectangle ect (not line though).
</p>

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s7test5.png" width=400 alt="Drawing for sprint 7">
<p>This is a picture that a user could create. However, there is a lack of curved lines. This is why I want to work on a brush button, so the user 
	could've created a better mouth and eyes as they would have access to curved/wiggly lines. 
<br> 
However it is important to note that I will keep in mind the problem that occured, that it is possible, even though unlikely, that a shape could disregard the boundary.
I decided to work on a brush for next sprint because it's another big step in my program, and this problem is only small at the moment. This is because the line isn't 
very thick at the moment, so it will never go too much past the boundary and isn't causing any problems. All I know is that I will get this problem fixed because I finish this 
project fully.

<h3>Test Two: Test the button connects</h3>
<p>I can see that the repeated circles that make up the brush work well. For the button to work I had to make sure to put the code to 
	instatiate the brush class was in the 'mMove' function as the circles need to called when the mouse moves not just when the move is clicked 
	and draged. The brush works well and the different colours work as well.

	<br>

	<video class="center" controls>
		<source src="assets/vids/s8test2.mov" type="video/mp4">

	The problem I found that I wasn't able to limit the brush to keep inside the drawing area. 
</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s8test3.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>


  <p>I decided to see if this was a problem for any of the other shapes. You can see that the other shapes kept inside the 
	  drawing area. From this I can conclude that this is a problem with only the brush. Looking at what is different from the brush compared 
	  to the other shapes, it's the fact that the brush is placed in the 'mMove' function and not 'mUp'. So I know I have to fix something involving  
	  'mMove'. 
	  <br>
	  The problem arised due to the fact that the inBoundsCheck, that runs when mouse is pressed down, is using the exact coordinates where 
	  the mouse was clicked down. This is because I set the coordinates (this.xMouseStart, this.yMouseStart) and returned true or false depending 
	   whether or not they are inside the drawing area. This works for the other shapes because for the shape to be created they have to click inside 
	   the drawing area, secondly, I have code that makes sure that the values (this.w and this.h) used to create the shapes will never be larger than the boundaries. So this 
	   solution only works the shapes and not the brush is because I don't use this.w and this.h to create the brush.
	   <br>
	   To fix this I put more conditions that have to occur before the brush is instaitated. As well as making sure the Brush button had to be selected 
	   and the mouse was down, the inBoundsCheck has to return true for the current positions of the mouse (x and y coordinates). This way, the brush (the small circles) 
	   will stop creating when the mouse goes out of the drawing area or if they lift their mouse. You can see the brush finally working properly.
	   <br>

	   <video class="center" controls>
		<source src="assets/vids/s8testaa.mov" type="video/mp4">
	  </video>
	  <p>I also tested the undo and clear all buttons here. The clear all works perfectly. But it clearly shows a limitation of the brush, which is that 
		  it can not be easily undo'd. This is because each circle created within the brush class is an object, therefore, only one circle (of the line drawn 
		  by the brush) is removed at one time. However, as seen by the test it doesn't take too long to remove a long brush line if a user needs to.
		  Although redesigning this part of my project would be a huge task and isn't a priority right now. Comparing the 
		  pros and cons of having a brush feature, I can conclude that giving the user's the opportunity to use this brush is more important that this small flaw. 
		  My program is still very usable and it may just take a little bit more time for a user if they make a mistake.
	  </p>

  </p>
 <br>

 <h3> Test 4: Looking at the line</h3>
 <p>After completing a lot of testing for the brush, I noticed that it is quite a bit confusing if there is no bounding box for the line. However, 
	 I still didn't like the look of the line with a bounding box. Because I this I seeked to find another solution. I decided that it would 
	 be better if the user could see the line that would be drawn before the line is instatiated and an element of the page. 
 </p>
  <p>I added this code. Which means that if the user selects Line, the code will create line that will represent the line that will be 
	 instatiated when the user's click goes up.

<h3>Iterative Decision</h3>
<p>I want to make sure that the user has options of different sized widths for the brush. It is apparant there there is more than 1 way of doing this.</p>

<div class="container">
	<div class="col">
<h4>Option 1</h4>
<p>Option 1 is to have a range of circle buttons that will determine the width of the brush. These circle buttons will need a new class and a new static variable
	that makes sure that only 1 brush option button can be selected at the same time, independent of the shape buttons.
	I think that having visual representations of how big the brush size will be good. Therefore these brush option buttons will be in a circle shape. 
	I will definetely need to make a new class for these circle buttons, as the code will be very different compared to square buttons

			<source src="assets/vids/s8testaaa3.mov" type="video/mp4">
		  </video>

		  <p>As you can see all the buttons work well, and if the user only pushes the Brush button they'll draw with a brush that is all the same 
			width as 'M'. And then the brush width selected will stay selected even if the user selects on another shape. This is what I want, 
		as it makes it easier if the user wanted to use the large brush width all the time instead of the default medium brush width.
	<br>
	Although this is the same kind of idea as the polygon option (number of sides) buttons, it is different. A static varaible carries the text of the button. 
	Therefore for the polygon option buttons, i was able to put this static varaible straight into the instatiation code as a variable. However, for brush length this was 
	not possible as the text of the button is either S, M or L. And these sizes then correlate to the brush width. Because of this I had to adapt my code 
	to fit this.
	</p>


	</div> 

	<div class="col">
		<h4>Option 2</h4>
		<p>Option 2 is to have 5 square buttons that will determine the size of the brush. I will add 5 more options in controlobject.js, 
			and for each I will change the radius of the circle. This is a more straightforward version and I will be able to carry this plan out 
		quickly as I can connect the new buttons with the already made button class in buttons.js.</p>

		<p>As you can see all the buttons work well, and if the user only pushes the Brush button they'll draw with a brush that is all the same 
			width as 'M'. However, the user would've had to test all the buttons first to see how big the brushes actually are, which is a big pain 
			especially if the user is in the middle of a big drawing project.

		<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/.png" height=700 >

</div>

	
<h4>Decision</h4>
	<p>I think option 1 is the better option because it is more functional as it would be super easy to add more buttons on that allow the user 
		to have different bursh widths. Secondly, it is better visually as the user will be able to see how big the brush is without having to go on a test 
		run first.

<h3>Test 3: Testing the brush</h3>
<p>I found that my brush goes slightly over the edge of the drawing area. This is the same problem I had with the line in the previous sprint, however, with the 
	brush it's more noticable as it has a bigger width so it can extend over the boundary further.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s8code11.png" height=200 alt="problem for sprint 8">

<p>To fix this I made sure to clip whatever that is not inside the drawing area. To do this I added 'ctx.save()', 'ctx.clip()' and 'ctx.restore()' 
	to the update function in control.object.js. This code will aslso help with same problem I had with the line.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p>I couldn't find anything else wrong with this version. I think that I could add a new button which gave the user a chance to do something new. 
	For this reason,next sprint I will work on a rotatng shape.

<p>	
	I think that my Agile process is really improving my ability to continue through these sprints at a quick pace. I can find an example of this at the moment. 
	The early sprint about making previous shape classes, button classes and connect the buttons up with controlobject.js and testing these elements so I know they 
	have no bugs whatsoever. This confindence in my previous sprints, that I've recieved through sticking to the thorough testing processes of Agile (testing after each 
	feature/sprint has been added) have really helped me to write code for this sprint (in making a brush with multiple options) efficiently without many errors.
	<br>
	For what to work on next, another shape button would help to expand the program.

<h2>AIM</h2>
<p> To create a diamond button
</p>

<h2>PLAN</h2> 
<p>A diamond is just a rotated square, so I know that i'll have research about how to rotated shapes. I looked at w3schools as shown below to 
	gather a general idea about how to draw a rotated object.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s9kanban.png" alt="The kanban sheet for sprint 9">


<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One: Testing that the diamond class works</h3>
<p>I tried to instantiate a single diamond. Something went completely wrong and the whole page got rotated. This is because inside the Diamond 
	class code I never saved and 
	restored it. So all the page element got permantently rotated instead of just the rotation for the creation of the diamond.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/1.png" height=400 alt="problem for sprint 9">
<p>To fix this I added 'ctx.save()'' to the begining of the draw function inside the Diamond class, and the 'ctx.restore()' to the end of the 
	draw function inside the Diamond class. This makes sure that the orginal orientation of the page is saved so it then can be restored to this original 
	orientation once the diamond is created.
</p>

<h3>Test Two: Testing the Diamond button works</h3>
<p>The diamond works well. However, there is not bounding box which is something I think would add value to my drawing page program.
	I also noticed that the save, clip and restore commands I added to the upadte function inside the controlobject.js last sprint is useful here as well.
	This is because it clips off the end of any shapes that go outside of the drawing area.
</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s9test1.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
<p>The bounding box was added sucessfully, as shown below. However, I can see that the diamond now doesn't fit inside of the bounding box properly.</p>
<video class="center" controls>
	<source src="assets/vids/s9test2.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

<h3>Solution to making sure the diamond is created inside the bounding box</h3>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s9planprob.png" height=400 alt="problem for sprint 9">
<p>I tried to fix it using a point to point drawing way to draw the diamond. When I tried to implement this into code, it didn't work. Through this test 
	I was able to figure out that this was due to keeping in the code that was used to rotate the canvas. So the diamonds would've been created in the lower right 
	corner of the canvas because the diamond were also drawn using the bounding box for reference. This doesn't work as previously in the code used to rotate the shape, 
	I set the origin (0,0) of the x and y axis of the page to be the centre of the shape. To fix this I removed all of the rotation code.
</p>

<h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>I am happy to add another shape button to my project as it improves the capabilties of my web program. Improving on this would to make a shape button with a twist, maybe 
	a shape that spins or something.

<br><br><h2>TESTING</h2> 
<h3>Test One:Testing the rotating ellipse itself</h3>
<p>What I supsect happened here was that ellipse kept getting bigger and bigger. This is because I increased the counter for 'xR' and 'yR'. To fix 
	this I made sure that the counter was only impacting the angle used to create the ellipse.

  <h3>Test Two:Testing the button for the rotating ellipse works</h3>
<p> It works perfectly. Also, if the rotating ellipse goes over the boundary of the drawing area, the save, clip and restore also works here to 
	clip the shape so it's inside the drawing area. Fortunately, the rotating ellipse works with the undo button. However, I would like to make sure that there's a bounding box for what the original position of the 
	the ellipse would look like.

<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p>Because I already had created the code for a regualar static ellipse, this made the process of getting it to spin easier. I'm pretty pleased with this web program now. 
	All the features on it are really creative and any user would thrive in this environment. To improve this program would just include adding more features and maybe redeisgning the layout.

<br><br><h2>REFLECTION</h2> 
<p>It is perfectly clear that I've made a high quality outcome. This is true as highlighted by the effective backlog project management system (with kanbans), 
	version control system (repository that has my sprints for each new feature),  and extensive trailing and testing processes. If I hadn't impliemented a backlog and kanbands (project 
	management system) I wouldn't have used prioritised my tasks well. I think it would've been easy getting caught coding countless shape buttons without considering the 
	important of other features like boundary checks and colourmanagment. 
	<br><br>
	If I hadn't implimented a version control system, tracking and managing the changes made to my code, I 
	think that I would've encountered a lot more issues, and perhaps some fatal issues. My repository that has the history of all the edits i've made and historical versions is such as asset 
	as it allows me the freedom to change anything I want on the original source code and knowing that I could go into github and find my last commited verision of my project. Additionally, it 
	makes it easier to manage all the changes that have been made to my code and what those changes were. As I push my code every sprint I know that I can find out what lines of code have been added 
	to create each feature (of the sprint) and what code I could've removed to fix a error. I have kept track of modifications made to my code and because of this my code is organised.
	The way I used iteration in the form of having a sprint for each additional feature added to the application has improved my productivity as it makes the
	 development process very efficient. It is efficient as I can make goals of completing each sprint inside a given timeframe, where I only have to focus on one feature 
	 instead of coming across a whole lot of issues and geting distracted by wanting to fix every issue that comes up even if it's insignificant and doesn't largely impact the 
	 functionality of the program. 
	 <br><br>

	 My thorough trailling and testing processes were a very useful way to pick up small and big problems while iterating. I found testing the most helpful as 
	 i managed to become aware of many issues while working on each sprint. Since I had this information and insight of what the problems were, I was able to distinguish between 
	  what problems needed fixing immediately and what 
	 problems were to go on the project backlog. 
	 <br><br>
	 My trailing processes made sure that I had the best solutions and implementations of new features which minimises the amount 
	 of problems I had in the future. By trialling alternative approaches I was able to deduct the best step forward and I didn't have to waste my time by implementing a ineffective 
	 solution and then find out in the next sprint that it created more problems. For instance, I was able to figure out that having a new object set (a new button class with different static variables) 
	 when introducing another set of options for polygons was the better option. It was good to figure out in the trailling process that this way was more functional and less cluttered than compared to 
	 changing a variable inside the instatiation of the polygon (adding mulitple buttons). If I had chosen this less effective option I might've been at sprint 11 and struggling to find any room on the page
	 as well as sifting through an abundance of code repetitions. The thorough testing process allowed me to pinpoint problems in my code so I could make the appropriate corrections.
	I made sure to test mulitple times throughout each sprint, more importantly I tested each time I added another element to the code. Another time where I explored different options is when I 
	decided how to limit the shapes to be only drawn inside the drawing area in one of the earlier sprints. I had one option to limit the bounding box from exceeding the drawing area and the other to save, clip and restore. I 
	chose limiting the bounding box from exceeding the drawing area to be the better solution because it indicated to the user that they should always stay inside of the drawing area because if their mouse went outside, 
	their bounding box would stop appearing. It was also important to keep testing these solutions in later sprints when more features had been added to see if this solution was still applicable. It was seen in 
	sprint 8 or so that for my program to work well I would actually need to incorprate both of these solution because both were needed for all of these shape options. This shows the intersection of maximising the advantages 
	of both trialling and testing. I was able to improve the functionality of my outcome through this.
	<br><br>
	Testing each element is very important because to get a high 
	quailty outcome all elements must perform is a efficient manner. When testing I found that objects could be created anywhere on the page and not just the drawing pages, in a early verision,
	this lead to the incorpration for the bounds check function. Because I did so much testing, I am more certain about the accuracy of my code as if I solved all significant issues with the code, I can 
	expect the code to be reliable. I found that testing helped me personally as it helped me spend less time on debugging my code. This is because each time I cam across a bug I knew it would 
	be from something in the code I added sinced my last sucessful test. And since I tested so frequently I didn't need to sort through hundreds of lines of code to find where I went wrong. For example, when 
	I was testing my brush I noticed that it went outside of the drawing area, because I had only incorprated the brush code that was inside controlobject.js, it narrowed down where I 
	was looking for an error.

</p>





<p><b>How to fix the current mouse listener problem</b>
	The problem is that the mouse up event is not recognise if the user goes beyound the boundary of the canvas.
This is a problem because the mouse listeners are only attached the the canvas.

Options 1) Allow the user to carry on (?) 

Option 2) When they draw out, the box goes up the boundary

Option 3) Create a clipping mask so everything that gets drawn after the canvas gets cut off

<h1><a id="0">OTHER </a></h1>
<h2> Using Github as a project management</h2>
<p>I used Github for a version control for my project so I could implement agile processes. 
	In software development, agile practices revolve around adaptive planning, quick development and continual 
	improvement. I bulit my project in the form of sprints where I did an iteration in a small timeframe for each sprint, 
	making sure I continuously went through the development cycle (plan, develop, build and evaluate, until development is complete). 
	I tested each sprint seperately before implementing it new functions/code into the main program, and when the main program was upto date 
	I would test again. Agile processes encourage flexible responses to change. I was able to do this by changing my plan of what to focus on in
	 the next sprint depending on what I uncovered during the testing stage. Each version of my code is stored on Github. My backlog Kanban sprint 
	 boards are also kept on Github, displaning my overall plan as well as my plan for each sprint. I commited each sprint to Github after I had completely
	  finished each sprint. I can access each sprint as well as my main program at any point through Github and see it displayed in the 'Network' 
	  section (as shown below).</p>

<h2>Project Backlog:</h2>
<p>I used a backlog to prioritise stages of work, this is an important part of an agile development. 
	My backlog displays a prioritised list of features to implement into my project. It presents the important tasks 
	that I have to do at the top of the list, which indicates to me which tasks I should be working on first. This made me 
	able to manage my project more easily as it gave me an idea of what to work on every lesson. I was able to estimate what 
	I would be working on and in which order, essiential a roadmap to the project. At the beginning of my project I had all my 
	features I wanted to add in the To-Do column in a prioritised order. As I was working through each sprint I would move the card 
	through the columns to completed. 
	Sometimes during testing of the sprints I would find another feature I would have to add and add it to the To-Do column. </p>
<p>What my project backlog looked at the beginning:</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/pb.png" height =500 alt="The project backlog">

<p>What it looked like in the middle:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/pba.png" height =500 alt="The project backlog">

<p>
	A backlog is a prioritized list of tasks that I needed to work on within the scope of this project. This strategy was incredible helpful for me to priorise what features 
	I had to add first. As you can see I priotised the major compments such as a couple of shape buttons, colour management and a working drawing area. Then I started to work on 
	more features such as other shape buttons such as Polygons and rotating ellipses. This is because the program would benefit significiantly more from a range of colour options than 
	a triangle option.
	<br>
	Through my testing and development of my program I have been able to think of new ideas during the process of making the web application. For this 
	reason, the backlog increases as I make the program. This is a good sign because I'm thinking of important features that a user would really appreciate and they 
	get added to this project backlog. This was very important because in sprint 5 I realised that the drawing page could get very cluttered and messy so I had to focus on 
	adding the feature of adding a clear and undo button.
	<br>
	I think the backlog helped me most while planning what I would work on each sprint. This project managament system taught me that the features that have the biggest yield, 
	the relatively biggest improvement to the program, would be the features that I should work on immediately. These high yield feature would include a drawing page and colour management 
	as these are huge componements of the web application. Getting further down my sprints, there was a trend on working on features that had lower yield, less significant improvments in my program. I 
	think that this signaled that I was coming to a nature reassing point of 'What is left to do?', other than test of more bugs. That is why you'll see that after sprint 5, the 
	majority of my energy is spent focused on developing more shape object buttons. I think that these features were crucial to fufilling my brief and making sure the user had enough freedom 
	to creat anything they wanted with geometric shapes. I think what's important to notes that this project management system really helped most in sprint 1 through to sprint 6. 
</p>

<br>
<h2>Standups:</h2>
<p>To make sure that I was on track and had a plan for the lesson, during the project i often had a short 
	assessing timeslot at the beginning of class. It would consist of questions of 1. what I had already completed, 2. 
	What I intend to work on today, and 3. what is blocking me for doing my task. This was incredibly helpful for me to 
	manage my project as it allows me to divide tasks into short phases of work e.g. working on one part of the project in one lesson 
	and other part in the next one. I can frequently reassess how I'm working and what is the most important at the present moment. 
	It also allows me to adaptat plans easily, as if I'm consistently reassessing, I can quickly shift my attention to the prioritised task.</p>
<br>

<h2>Relevant Implications</h2>

<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>The relevant implication of usability is about making sure the program is easy to use which will help minimise errors. To address this implication, I made sure there were 
	ways my program tried to decrease the number of errors that the user could make - therefore, I made a simple interface. I did this by making sure that the user 
	was aware of what they were doing on the interface at each time. Firstly, I made sure that the user knows that they can interact with buttons (if they click on it something 
	will happen) as I had different hover colours and outline widths. Secondly, I made sure that the user knows that the drawing area is available to draw on as well, by making sure 
	that a bounding box is drawn when the user clicks down on there. Thirdly, I made sure that the options are in a logical place so the user is easily able to assess what to click 
	on first - the options for particular shapes e.g. number of sides for the polygons, is close to the general shape button, e.g. polgon button. I made These 3 decision about how 
	I designed the user interface to make the application more usable and easier to use.

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/pba11.png" alt="The usability image">
<br>
</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>
	I had to make sure I addressed the relevant implication of functionality to make sure I built a functional program that works well. Important things to consider 
	while doing this is to make sure the program is free from bugs and loads quickly. I also tested my project to make sure it works on different browers e.g. Chrome and Safari.
<br>
	I have addressed this relevant implication by doing regular and systematic tests to find bugs 
	in my program, so when it was finished I could ensure the user that there were no bugs. I tested at every single sprint inside the testing file and then again when 
	I implemented the new feature into the main file. Secondly, I tested the individual functions to make sure they worked before incorporating into the main program
	 crash so I wouldn’t make the main file have a bug. I tested using console logs, testing videos, user interactions ect. Console logging was crucial to making sure that my boundaries were correct, and 
	 it helped me to locate the problematic parts of the code when a bug appeared. I also found it incredibly useful to test position by clicking and 
	 dragging in various directions, carefully checking the boundaries, using 'Math.abs' when drawing circular shapes as these objection were orginally been given negative radius values.
	 <br>
	 To make sure that my drawing board loads quickly, I addressed this as my code is in pure javascript and has no graphics. I tested this by using the live web server (found on Github) 
	 to test the loading performance. I can see that my project has a small file size which allows my program to run quickly.

</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/pba1111.png" height=300 alt="The functionality image">
<br>
<h3>Future Proofing</h3>
<p>The relevant implication of future-proofing is all about the flexibility of the code. A program that is future-proofed well makes it easy to update or add new features and that old features are easy to remove. 
	The code also has to follow industry standards so it’s easy for different programmers to understand and even adapt the code. Fundamentally, future-proofing is 
	making sure that the code is ‘easy’ to understand. 
	<br>
	I addressed this relevant implication by building my program around a structure that means that each new feauture or page element that is added (swatches, buttons ect.) are all added 
	to the code as objects. These objects are all individual modular bits of code, all taking set parameters and information to work. Since all objects that are added are bulit to 
	similar strucutres and all contain update functions, all objects appear on the interface when using the update call. To make sure that my code was future proofed, I made sure that the management 
	of most objects (that dictact page elements) are inside controlobject.js, a central  place. The entire code is designed in a way that if another programmer looked at my prgram, they could easily interpret what my code means, 
	add components or remove featutres. It also helps that my comments are informative and frequent. I addressed this relevant implication as I was able to make sure the code fit industry standards. The code checker made sure that my code 
	fit with javascript conventions. 
	<br>
	Adding new features is easy, especially considering that i have loops in main.js to make sure the addition of new similar feautres such as new buttons, is added easily. I have found it easy 
	myself to add new feautres in each sprint as my programme has been deisgned well, as addressed above.
